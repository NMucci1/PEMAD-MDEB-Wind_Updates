OBJECTID,,
RCID,Record identification number,The only constraint on usage of this subfield is that the concatenation of the RCID and RCNM subfields must be unique within the file in which the record is contained.
PRIM,Object geometric primitive,
GRUP,Group,Used to separate feature objects into groups
OBJL,Object label/code,A valid object label/code
RVER,Record version,Record version is used for updating and contains the serial number of the record edition
AGEN,Producing Agency,Numeric agency code
FIDN,Feature identification number,The “Feature Object Identification Number” ranges from 1 to 232-2. The “Feature Object Identification Subdivision” ranges from 1 to 216-2. Both subfields are used to create an unique key for a feature object produced by the agency encoded in the AGEN subfield. The usage of the FIDN and FIDS subfields is not constrained and must be defined by the encoder.
FIDS,Feature identification subdivision,The “Feature Object Identification Number” ranges from 1 to 232-2. The “Feature Object Identification Subdivision” ranges from 1 to 216-2. Both subfields are used to create an unique key for a feature object produced by the agency encoded in the AGEN subfield. The usage of the FIDN and FIDS subfields is not constrained and must be defined by the encoder.
LNAM,Long name,"Long name.  An encoding of AGEN, FIDN and FIDS used to uniquely identify this features within an S-57 file."
LNAM_REFS,Long name references,List of long names of related features
FFPT_RIND,Feature to feature object pointer relationship indicator,Relationship indicators for each of the LNAM_REFS relationships.
BOYSHP,Buoy shape,Buoy shape; the principal shapes are those recommended in the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities - IALA System.
CATSPM,Category of special purpose mark,"A mark may be a beacon, a buoy, a signpost or may take another form. Value number 38 should be encoded using object class signal station, traffic (SISTAT)."
COLOUR,Color,"Color; must be encoded for all LIGHTS objects, except air obstruction lights or fog detector lights."
COLPAT,Color pattern,Color pattern; Mandatory for ANY OBJECT that has more than one colour.
CONRAD,"Conspicuous, radar",Radar conspicuous
DATEND,Date end,The attribute 'date end' indicates the latest date on which an object (e.g. a buoy) will be present. This attribute is to be used to indicate the removal or cancellation of an object at a specific date in the future. See also 'periodic date end'
DATSTA,Date start,"The attribute 'date, start' indicates the earliest date on which an object (e.g. a buoy) will be present. This attribute is to be used to indicate the deployment or implementation of an object at a specifi c date in the future. See also 'periodic date start'."
MARSYS,Navigational marks,System of navigational marks
NATCON,Nature of construction,
NOBJNM,Object name in national language,The attribute 'object name in national language' encodes the individual name of an object in the specified national language.
OBJNAM,Object name,The individual name of an object.
PEREND,Periodic date end,The end of the active period for a seasonal object (e.g. a buoy). See also 'date end'.
PERSTA,Periodic date start,The start of the active period for a seasonal object (e.g. a buoy). See also 'date start'.
STATUS,Status,Object status
VERACC,Vertical accuracy,"The best estimate of the vertical accuracy of heights, vertical distances and vertical clearances, excluding sounding measurements."
VERLEN,Vertical length,The total vertical length of an object.
INFORM,Information,Textual information about the object.
NINFOM,Information in national language,Textual information in national language characters
NTXTDS,Textual description in national language,Indicates whether a text file containing text extracted from relevant pilot books or navigational publications is available.
PICREP,Pictorial representation,Indicates whether a pictorial representation of the object is available.
SCAMAX,Scale maximum,The maximum scale at which the object may be used e.g. for ECDIS presentation.
SCAMIN,Scale minimum,The minimum scale at which the object may be used e.g. for ECDIS presentation.
TXTDSC,Textual description,Indicates that a file containing text extracted from relevant pilot books or navigational publications is available.
RECDAT,Recording date,"The date when the specific object or cartographic primitive was captured, edited or deleted."
RECIND,Recording indication,The procedure for the encoding and entering of data
SORDAT,Source date,"The production date of the source, e.g. the date of measurement."
SORIND,Source indication,Information about the source of the object.
SOURCE_FILE,Source file,NOAA ENC file name of source data
