OBJECTID,,
RCID,Record identification number,The only constraint on usage of this subfield is that the concatenation of the RCID and RCNM subfields must be unique within the file in which the record is contained.
PRIM,Object geometric primitive,
GRUP,Group,Used to separate feature objects into groups
OBJL,Object label/code,A valid object label/code
RVER,Record version,Record version is used for updating and contains the serial number of the record edition
AGEN,Producing Agency,Numeric agency code
FIDN,Feature identification number,The “Feature Object Identification Number” ranges from 1 to 232-2. The “Feature Object Identification Subdivision” ranges from 1 to 216-2. Both subfields are used to create an unique key for a feature object produced by the agency encoded in the AGEN subfield. The usage of the FIDN and FIDS subfields is not constrained and must be defined by the encoder.
FIDS,Feature identification subdivision,The “Feature Object Identification Number” ranges from 1 to 232-2. The “Feature Object Identification Subdivision” ranges from 1 to 216-2. Both subfields are used to create an unique key for a feature object produced by the agency encoded in the AGEN subfield. The usage of the FIDN and FIDS subfields is not constrained and must be defined by the encoder.
LNAM,Long name,"Long name.  An encoding of AGEN, FIDN and FIDS used to uniquely identify this features within an S-57 file."
LNAM_REFS,Long name references,List of long names of related features
FFPT_RIND,Feature to feature object pointer relationship indicator,Relationship indicators for each of the LNAM_REFS relationships.
CATLMK,Category of Landmark,Landmark type
COLOUR,Color,"Color; must be encoded for all LIGHTS objects, except air obstruction lights or fog detector lights."
COLPAT,Color pattern,Color pattern; Mandatory for ANY OBJECT that has more than one colour.
CONDTN,Condition,"The attribute ‘condition’ encodes the various conditions of buildings and other constructions. The default ‘condition’ should be considered to be completed, undamaged and working normally. This attribute should, therefore, only be used to indicate objects whose condition is anything other than ‘normal’."
CONRAD,"Conspicuous, radar",Radar conspicuous
CONVIS,"Conspicuous, visually",Visually conspicuous
ELEVAT,Elevation,"The altitude of the ground level of an object, measured from a specified vertical datum."
FUNCTN,Function,Object function
HEIGHT,Height,"The value of the vertical distance to the highest point of the object, measured from a specifie d vertical datum."
NATCON,Nature of construction,
NOBJNM,Object name in national language,The attribute 'object name in national language' encodes the individual name of an object in the specified national language.
OBJNAM,Object name,The individual name of an object.
STATUS,Status,Object status
VERACC,Vertical accuracy,"The best estimate of the vertical accuracy of heights, vertical distances and vertical clearances, excluding sounding measurements."
VERDAT,Vertical datum,"This attribute is used to specify the datum to which both heights (vertical datum, see S- 57 Part 3) and soundings (sounding datum, see S-57 Part 3) are referred. When the vertical datum is unknown, such as water areas above locks, the value ‘local datum’ is to be used, and further details may be encoded using ‘INFORM’. The ï¿½ 0.3m approximation quoted in the “approximate” levels is somehow arbitrary and follows the British example of their definition for “approximate LAT”."
VERLEN,Vertical length,The total vertical length of an object.
INFORM,Information,Textual information about the object.
NINFOM,Information in national language,Textual information in national language characters
NTXTDS,Textual description in national language,Indicates whether a text file containing text extracted from relevant pilot books or navigational publications is available.
PICREP,Pictorial representation,Indicates whether a pictorial representation of the object is available.
SCAMAX,Scale maximum,The maximum scale at which the object may be used e.g. for ECDIS presentation.
SCAMIN,Scale minimum,The minimum scale at which the object may be used e.g. for ECDIS presentation.
TXTDSC,Textual description,Indicates that a file containing text extracted from relevant pilot books or navigational publications is available.
RECDAT,Recording date,"The date when the specific object or cartographic primitive was captured, edited or deleted."
RECIND,Recording indication,The procedure for the encoding and entering of data
SORDAT,Source date,"The production date of the source, e.g. the date of measurement."
SORIND,Source indication,Information about the source of the object.
SOURCE_FILE,Source file,NOAA ENC file name of source data
